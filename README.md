# NextJs Routing Exercise

This project is a Next.js application built to practice using Next.js features such as routing, page creation, layouts, and dynamic routes. It also focuses on handling loading UI, data fetching, and managing the fetching state.

## Features

- **Routing with Next.js**: The project demonstrates the usage of Next.js for efficient routing within the application. Next.js provides a built-in routing system that allows for easy navigation between different pages.

- **Page Creation and Layouts**: Next.js enables the creation of individual pages as components. The project showcases the organization of pages and the usage of layouts to maintain consistent UI elements across multiple pages.

- **Dynamic Routes**: Next.js supports dynamic routes, allowing for the creation of dynamic URLs with parameters. The project explores the handling of dynamic routes to display dynamic content based on the provided parameters.

- **Loading UI Handling**: The application demonstrates how to handle loading states during data fetching using Next.js. It utilizes loading indicators and provides a smooth user experience while waiting for data to be fetched.

- **Error Handling**: Next.js provides error handling mechanisms for handling errors during data fetching or page rendering. The project focuses on displaying error messages to users and providing fallback UIs when errors occur

## ABOUT ME 
I am delighted that you have taken an interest in my project. At 26 years old, I hold a degree in mechanical engineering. Following graduation, I spent approximately five months working as an engineer in a specific field. However, during this time, I realized that the role did not align with my aspirations and overall satisfaction.

Driven by my passion for coding, software, and computer components, I extensively researched various career options, ultimately gravitating towards web development. The more I delved into this field, the stronger my interest grew. I became determined to excel as a talented frontend web developer. Notably, my engineering background has equipped me with highly organized and systematic work habits, facilitating effective learning and contributing significantly to my educational journey.

I hope this brief introduction has provided you with insight into my background and motivations without becoming overly tedious.
